# Problem: Create a lambda function to compute the cube of a number.
'''
A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function that can have any number of arguments but only one expression. It is often used for short, simple functions that donâ€™t require a full def function definition.

When to Use Lambda Functions?
âœ… When you need a short function for a single-use case.
âœ… When using higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted().
âœ… When writing concise and readable code.

âš  Avoid lambda functions if the logic is complexâ€”use def instead for better readability.
